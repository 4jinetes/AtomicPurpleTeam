## Background
Kent and Jordan have been working in Information Security for quite awhile now.  Despite working with Red-Teams and learning the adversarial toolsets, we are still blue-blood at heart. It gave us an opportunity to reflect at while the past years' Purple Teaming efforts never seemed as effective as they could (should) have been.  

Leveraging their background in business leadership, Kent and Jordan sought to create a business framework that would avoid the pitfalls of cooperate career identity ambiguity and instead focus on what skills Information Security Professionals have spent years mastering.

### Namesake
in 2019 Defensive Originals was founded as a research and knowledge opportunity institution.  The first class was titled "Atomic Purple Teaming".   The class was great, however the title of the course offered some in the community confusion, expecting an automation or solution based framework more tightly aligned with Red Canary's[ Atomic Red Team][1] project.  Despite having self published their first book, Atomic Purple Team, Defensive Origins pivoted and re-titled their classroom instructional series, Applied Purple Teaming.  

The Applied Purple Teaming course continues to grow, updating and adding additional attack-detect-defend exercises offering students practical experience.  Many students acknowledged the courses' foundational chapter focusing on a business framework and life-cyclee supportive of attack-detect-defend activities as being potentially pivotal in their own organization.  At students requests, Defensive Origins chose to release the frameworkand lifeecyclee as an open source initiative, titling the project after its first instructional course the **Atomic Purple Team Framework**.

While the framework does not necessarily provide automated adversarial attacks in the same capacity of the Atomic Red Team project, it is designed to provide businesses a framework for deploying, maintaining, and justifying continued Attack-Detect-Defend security excises.



## Announcement and Open Source
Defensive Origins announced the release of the Atomic Purple Team as a GNU3 open source project hoping to democratize the framework in such a way to allow other organizations to increase their information security posture by utilizing their existing skilled workforce without having to pay hefty licensing, consulting, or subscriptions services.  The team rather enjoys teaching organizations and professionals expert technique and business knowhow.
